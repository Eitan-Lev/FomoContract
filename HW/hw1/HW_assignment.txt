
For the entire exercise It is Ok to get from the web mod arithmetic, but not more. Clearly mark code obtained from external sources. 

RSA-Sign and verify a message (number)
Use Python or a language of your choice. You can take a multiplicative inverse modulo implementation from the Internet, but nothing else.

Given the primes p=4973 and q=5347, and randomly chosen e=1547,

(a) calculate the public key (n, e) and private key d.

(b) Sign the message m=122 and verify that the signature is valid.

Submit the program and the signature. 

Elliptic Curve Example
Find all the points in the elliptic curve y^2=x^3-5x+8 in the finite field F_37. 

Submit the program and points.

For the two points in the curve P=(6, 3) and Q=(9, 10) calculate 2P, 3P, P+Q. 
Submit the program and results.
